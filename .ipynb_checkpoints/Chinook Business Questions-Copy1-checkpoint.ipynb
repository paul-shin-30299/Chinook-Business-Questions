We only have 1 album within the top 3 genres which is Punk, and even then its split between Alternative and Punk. If we assume that Alternative & Punk are split 50-50 then the number of tracks sold and revenue are still higher than the other three options. Then Blues would come in second, and we have to decide between Pop and Hip-Hop. When we look at the remaining two genres, the genres are close in sales numbers (Pop being slightly ahead), but Hip-Hop makes more revenue. Taking revenue as a more important indicator, this concludes that the three albums we can look to promote are from the artists Regal, Red Tone, and Slim Jim Bites."

This can be a result from the hire date, as those who have been hired earlier could have more customers or customers for longer to contribute to their total sales number. As we can see from the table above, Jane has the highest total sales and was the first hired sales support agent, while Steve is the opposite.Margaret has more customers, but has only 2 more customers.
